## What is this?

This is **CanvasScrolledText**. This is an attempt to use Canvas text object as a scrollable text/label thing. I want to have background image under some text but I cannot achieve this via native Tkinter widgets, therefore this is created. This is only for fun and is my 'Hello World' to Tkinter.

## How to run

* Clone this repo
* `pipenv install` // Optional?
* `python canvas_scrolled_text_demo1.py` to see the general demo
* `python canvas_scrolled_text_demo2.py` to see the minimal code to use CanvasScrolledText
